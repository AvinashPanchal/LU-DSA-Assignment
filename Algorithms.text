Question - WWhen should you choose linear search and when should you choose binary search. ?
Answer - When an array is the data structure and elements are arranged in sorted order, then binary search is preferred for quick searching. 
         If linked list is the data structure regardless how the elements are arranged, 
         linear search is adopted due to unavailability of direct implementation of binary search algorithm.
